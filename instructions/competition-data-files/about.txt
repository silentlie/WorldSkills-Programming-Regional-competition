Ticked Off Vet
--------------

Ticked Off is a long-established vet practice that has been operating in the Hornsby area of Sydney for many years. Keith Cabrade, son-in-law of long-term businessman Victor Grahams, owns the magical practice.

Ticked Off has recently received a series of accolades from the industry for their ingenious invention of the easy-tick-disposal product, the Pop Bag. This incredibly clever invention has catapulted Ticked Off to veterinary fame in a way that no bag has done before!
